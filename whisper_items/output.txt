 Hey everyone, I'm your public servant. And I'm always right. And welcome back to 
 1000 lives where we talk about everything books. In today's episode we'll 
 be talking about one flu over the cuckoo's nest. This story follows a group 
 of patients oppressed by a mental institution. However, with the admittance 
 of a new rowdy patient named McMurphy, the social landscape of the institution 
 changes. McMurphy challenges the oppression of the institution by 
 outwardly showing his sexuality and rallying the other patients to regain 
 their humanity. We believe this would be interesting to talk about as it deals 
 with freedom, hierarchy and mental illnesses, topics we still discuss to 
 this day in our political climate. One flew over the cuckoo's nest is 
 emotionally charged, unapologetic and very often upsetting. Some chapters were 
 especially difficult to swallow. Despite that it was one of my favorite reads ever, 
 let alone one of my favorites from this year and I would definitely recommend 
 the book to any reader our age. Not many books involve topics such as mental 
 health asylums, patient disenfranchisement and the dehumanizing combine as 
 directly or as well as cuckoo's nest. The clever narrative techniques provided 
 through a mute schizophrenic narrator creates a story full of scathing irony 
 and social critique that offers an unreliable, false but genuine and 
 adulterated truth. Before we start this episode I wanted to introduce our 
 special guests for the day. We are joined in the studio by Bustin, the head 
 physician for a nearby psychiatric ward. Could you tell us a little bit about 
 your line of work? Thanks so much for having me. Like your public servant said, 
 I'm Bustin. I'm head physician for a town psychiatric ward and my job is to 
 prescribe medicine to my patients in the hope of rehabilitating them. We also have 
 another special guest today, Head Empty, a sociology professor. Hello everyone, I'm 
 Head Empty and I'm so excited to be here today. While we're on the topic of 
 psychiatric ward professionals, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite 
 characters in the novel. Big Nurse is such a powerful, complex character that 
 serves as a symbolic head for so many ideas. Her title as head of the mental 
 institution dictates her to help the patients, but she controls the patients 
 through such cruel and conniving methods.
